# CoreBot
An open source discord bot that interacts with the Core API. 

It is reccomended that you have some nodejs knowledge before messing around in here.

To set up, set the values in the config file. 
The token will be your bots token that you have gotten from the Discord Devoloper Portal.
The email + password will be to a Core Account that you have set up, these will be used to login and generate authTokens so that some features can be used in the Core API such as viewing Community Content, and a few other things.

The rest is up to you!
